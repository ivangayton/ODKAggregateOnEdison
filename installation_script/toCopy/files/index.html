<center><h1>Welcome to the Missing Maps Micro-server.</h1>
<p>You are not on the Internet. This page is hosted on a tiny server near you.</p>
<p> Here is the local <a href='http://192.168.0.1:8080/ODKAggregate'>Aggregate server.</a> Connect to it to upload blank forms and download completed forms. Use the same URL to connnect your ODK Collect applications on your surveyor's phones to the server.</p>
<p>You should install ODKCollect on your phone. Get it <a href='/files/ODK Collect v1.4.6 rev 1051.apk' download>here</a>.</p>
<p>Here, for that matter, is a copy of <a href='/files/net.osmand.plus_212.apk' download>OSMAND</a> which should be very helpful for navigating.</p>
<p>And here is the OSMAND <a href='/files/map.obf' download>map file for your working area</a>.</p>
