# ODKAggregateOnEdison
A recipe for taking an Intel Edison System-on-a-chip computer and deploying it as an OpenDataKit ODKAggregate server.

The bulk of the project, for the moment, is the Wiki!  Please look in the Wiki: https://github.com/ivangayton/ODKAggregateOnEdison/wiki, Especially here: https://github.com/ivangayton/ODKAggregateOnEdison/wiki/001-Full-Instructions.

In the fullness of time, we intend to create 1) a script to automate this process, and 2) a flashable image that you can simply throw onto an Edison and get started right away.  However, this is a start, and should allow someone with moderately advanced computer skills (basically a good working knowledge of UNIX) to set up a really useful offline OpenDataKit aggregation server.

This project is created by the members of the Missing Maps, a collaboration of Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders, the British Red Cross, American Red Cross, and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, intended to encourage the creation of maps where the most vulnerable people in the world live.
